Identifies correlated indicators based on tags or similar attributes
Implements custom analysis logic and mitigation actions
Extracts additional information, such as country, for further analysis
Provides flexibility to handle and present errors using custom exceptions
Usage:

Input your Threat Intelligence Platform API key
Specify the indicator you want to analyze
The code will fetch the threat data, perform analysis, and display the results
It calculates the threat score, identifies correlated indicators, and performs custom analysis based on the threat data
If the indicator is classified as malicious, it suggests mitigation actions
The code also allows for country-based analysis and actions
Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder API key in the code with your own valid API key to access the Threat Intelligence Platform API.

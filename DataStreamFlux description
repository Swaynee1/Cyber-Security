ConcurrentHashMap
A thread-safe hash map implementation with concurrent access and modification. Features efficient locking, standard operations (put, get, remove), key existence check, iterable interface, size check, and more.
Usage:
1. Create an instance of ConcurrentHashMap.
2. Use put to insert or update key-value pairs.
3. Use get to retrieve the value associated with a key.
4. Use remove to delete a key-value pair.
5. Utilize other methods like contains, keys, values, items, size, and is_empty as needed.
Note: Ensure proper synchronization for multi-threaded access.
Ideal for concurrent data access scenarios, providing safe and efficient hash map operations.
